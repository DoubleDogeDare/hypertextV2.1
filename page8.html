<p><font color="orange" size="5"> Liberal Arts = Lifelong Success
Exploring is at the core of Lewis & Clark’s identity, and our liberal arts education reflects that. Studying the liberal arts means that all of your classes will be grounded in critical thinking, written and verbal communication, teamwork, and problem solving. You’ll draw on these skills throughout your life, no matter where you work or what you do.<br>

You will take approximately 32 courses during your time here, and you’ll have choices when it comes to every single one. Your classes will be split roughly into thirds: general education, major requirements, and electives.<br>

General education classes cover your first-year seminar course plus requirements in world languages, global and historical perspectives, creative arts, natural sciences, physical education and well-being, and more. You can choose from a wide variety of classes in many disciplines to complete this general education coursework, while your major courses give you the opportunity for in-depth study.<br>

Our undergraduate curriculum is designed to be completed in four years. We’re so committed to that timeline that if it takes you longer than four years, we’ll cover an extra semester of tuition. Want even more of the Lewis  &  Clark experience? We also offer a five-year bachelor’s + master’s in teaching degree (MAT) with our graduate school and a six-year bachelor’s + law degree (JD) with our law school</font></p>
