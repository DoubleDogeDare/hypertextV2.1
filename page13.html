<p><center><font color="orange" size="5">The Forest Complex, located at the southwest corner of campus, consists of five independent buildings (Alder, Manzanita, Juniper, Spruce, & Ponderosa) and a sixth central building (Tamarack) that serves as a main lounge area. Each of the five buildings has two stories, housing ten to thirty-two people. Every floor in Forest includes a small kitchen, as well as a lounge used for relaxation and study. Single, double, and quad occupancy rooms contribute to the comfortable small group living atmosphere.<br>

While taking advantage of the opportunities offered by our smaller, independent Halls, we still take care to offer the amenities of a more traditional, larger living environment.  Upper Tamarack — in addition to the AD office — contains a large lounge with a fireplace, kitchen, piano, and big screen TV with VCR and DVD players.<br>


Manzanita is home to the Environmental Action Living-Learning Community as well as the Outdoor Pursuits Living-Learning Community, while Alder houses the EduComm Living-Learning Community. Please visit the respective LLC webpages for more details as well as the application.<br>

Juniper, renovated during the summer of 2014, contains 29 singles with extra-long double beds, and is ideal for upper-classmen living.</center></font></p>
