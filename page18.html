<p><font color="orange" font="5">The Joe Huston Memorial Sports Complex, located at 10120 SW Boones Ferry Road, just off Terwilliger Blvd., directly behind the Lewis & Clark College School of Law, is home to both Pioneer baseball and softball fields. The Huston Sports Complex is named in honor of Joe Huston, football coach at Lewis & Clark for seventeen seasons. As the plaque at the complex declares, Huston was a “friend, Coach-Athletic Director-Dean of Men” from 1947-1972.<br>
     <br>Originally built as a practice and intramural facility, it was upgraded to become the permanent home of the Pioneer baseball and softball teams in the late 70’s. Softball first began playing at “Huston Field” in 1979, having previously called Falcon Park  their home field. Baseball moved from Sckavone Field (SE 22nd & McLoughlin) to Huston Field in 1980.
     The Huston Sports Complex has been evolving through the years. In 1993, a baseball pressbox, double-batting tunnels, and dugouts were added.  In recent years, new wooden grandstands were added to the softball side to improve the fans’ game day experience. In 2005, a new scoreboard with full line-score display was installed at the softball field.
     The softball field has bleacher seating, as well as a renovated area with a spacious tiered wooden platform, perfect for bringing your own comfortable chairs to sit in. The field has great sight lines and a lush, green backdrop, making it an incredible place to take in an afternoon of Pioneer softball. The baseball field features traditional stadium seats behind home plate and bleacher seating down both lines.</p>
